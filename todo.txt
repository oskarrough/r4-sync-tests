# Todos

List of possible improvements to the architecture, idea, cli and web application.  
Verify and evaluate todos before taking them on. They might be outdated or just not good ideas.

## Backlog

- What should happen when you play a track that is not part of the current loaded playlist? Replace playlist (with what?)? Just play, ignore palyslist?
- allow users to mark a musicbrainz or discogs meta track data as wrong. Since we auto-match on the track title, there's a relatively high chance it's wrong. If it's wrong, users can delete the meta data for that track. But then it'd just match it again on reload. How do we deal with this, do we spend effort on this?
- when is a local channel updated again (pulled)? To get any  new tracks via outdated(). 
- make a great (!) flow for creating a new radio, and maybe also migrate v1?!
- run `bun run check` and slowly get rid of these warnings - tidy codebase
- analyze https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/$effect#When-not-to-use-$effect - keep up with Svelte 5 patterns
- group metadata enrichment functions (youtube, musicbrainz) under single namespace "metadata" instead of "sync" - better organization
- move sync/followers into lib/r5 namespace. think hard about the the pullFollowers logic. Maybe get rid of `syncFollowers`, we use "pull" naming in other places. Is it because it doesn't overwrite local, but merge into local? seems hard. hmm
- consider integrating "bandsintown" as a third-party API similar to musicbrainz, youtube meta - rich data connections
- Test we can export browser pglite and import and verify that - solid foundation for experimentation
- implement "queue" to the r5 api - marginal UX improvement
- V1 compatibility: v1 channels can't be bookmarked/broadcasted because remote supabase doesn't know about their foreign keys. V1 channels have firebase_id but don't exist in remote postgres, causing FK constraint failures. Solution ideas: use string-based IDs instead of proper foreign keys, or create placeholder records in remote for v1 channels.
- implement event sourcing pattern: events table {type, payload, timestamp} for state changes, enables undo/replay
- add validation layer at sync boundaries (remote->local) using lightweight lib like zod 4
- implement backup/restore: export/import full pglite database as json or sql dump
- enhance logger: expose store.logs in devtools ui
- separate api layers: split ui operations (toggleTheme, openSearch) from data operations in api.js
- extract reusable debouncing utility instead of per-component implementation
- clarify data flow patterns - document and standardize when operations hit local vs remote database
- implement sync resumption - track sync progress in db, allow continuation of interrupted syncs
- create standardized loading/error boundaries for async operations in ui
- consolidate follower sync logic into single flow, remove complex local-user migration
- refactor broadcast architecture - remove module-level state, fix implicit dependencies, add cleanup on failures
- the <youtube-player> fires volumechange seemingly at will, many times on load, which currently overwrites any appState.volume the user might already have. In other words, your volume preferences is persisted, but also overwritten on load
- find a way to share `track_meta` data between users. push it remote, how? security?
- We're using the media-chrome project for the player. It supports audio, video and different third-party "media elements" like YouTube, Spotify and others. But there's no Soundcloud, which some R4 radios use. If we wanna keep Soundcloud, we have to make a player for it. https://www.media-chrome.org/docs/en/media-element#compatible-media-elements
- cli: Better progress reporting with download speeds, concurrent status
- cli: allow sql queries 
- cli download error handling: retry logic, download state tracking, failure persistence
- cli download file scanning: old CLI scans `<folder>/<slug>/tracks/*.m4a`, new CLI has no file ops
