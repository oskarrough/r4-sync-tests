# Todos

List of possible improvements to the architecture, idea, cli and web application.  
Always verify and evaluate todos before taking them on. They might be outdated or just not good ideas.

- move pglite to worker in browser? 
- consider integrating "bandsintown" as a third-party API similar to musicbrainz, youtube meta - rich data connections
- Test we can export browser pglite and import and verify that - solid foundation for experimentation
- analyze https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/$effect#When-not-to-use-$effect - keep up with Svelte 5 patterns
- move spam detection out of playground into proper module if keeping
- V1 compatibility: v1 channels can't be bookmarked/broadcasted because remote supabase doesn't know about their foreign keys. V1 channels have firebase_id but don't exist in remote postgres, causing FK constraint failures. Solution ideas: use string-based IDs instead of proper foreign keys, or create placeholder records in remote for v1 channels.

## Nice Cleanup (when bored)

- run `bun run check` and slowly get rid of these warnings - tidy codebase
- group metadata enrichment functions (youtube, musicbrainz) under single namespace "metadata" instead of "sync" - better organization
- move sync/followers into lib/r5 namespace. think hard about the the pullFollowers logic. Maybe get rid of `syncFollowers`, we use "pull" naming in other places. Is it because it doesn't overwrite local, but merge into local? seems hard. hmm

## Low Priority

- implement "queue" to the r5 api - marginal UX improvement
- ~~change <slug>/page.js load function to maybe not block the whole page? too slow~~ - owner says it's already fast
- the cli only works in bun (not node) because of $lib alias and typescript
- implement event sourcing pattern: events table {type, payload, timestamp} for state changes, enables undo/replay
- unify sync layer: single sync_operations queue table instead of scattered pull/push functions
- refactor persistAppState() to use parameterized queries instead of string concatenation
- add validation layer at sync boundaries (remote->local) using lightweight lib like valibot
- implement backup/restore: export/import full pglite database as json or sql dump
- enhance logger: expose store.logs in devtools ui
- separate api layers: split ui operations (toggleTheme, openSearch) from data operations in api.js
- extract reusable debouncing utility instead of per-component implementation
- clarify data flow patterns - document and standardize when operations hit local vs remote database
- implement sync resumption - track sync progress in db, allow continuation of interrupted syncs
- create standardized loading/error boundaries for async operations in ui
- consolidate follower sync logic into single flow, remove complex local-user migration
- refactor broadcast architecture - remove module-level state, fix implicit dependencies, add cleanup on failures
- the <youtube-player> fires volumechange seemingly at will, many times on load, which currently overwrites any appState.volume the user might already have. In other words, your volume preferences is persisted, but also overwritten on load
- find a way to share `track_meta` data between users. push it remote, how? security?

## CLI & LLM INTEGRATION LEARNINGS

- search functionality works but needed better context understanding - improve CLI help/examples for complex queries  
- natural language search patterns unclear - document search operators (AND, OR, phrase matching) in CLI help
- verify we can write arbitrary sql queries locally??
- genre cross-analysis queries powerful but not obvious - add examples to CLI help
- LLM integration reveals rich semantic connections - consider exposing more metadata fields for search
  - Progress system: @opentf/cli-pbar, ETA calculations, download statistics
  - Error handling: retry logic, download state tracking, failure persistence
  - File scanning: old CLI scans `<folder>/<slug>/tracks/*.m4a`, new CLI has no file ops
- cli: Better progress reporting with download speeds, concurrent status
