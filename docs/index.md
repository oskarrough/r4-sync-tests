r5 is a local-first music player prototype. 

- pulls data from Radio4000 v1 (firebase) and v2 (r4)
- inserts it into your local in-browser (pg) database
- is built as a SvelteKit client-only web app

## architecture & data flow

```
+------------------+     +-------------------+     +------------------+
|   Local PGlite   | <-> |      r5 SDK       | <-> |  Remote Sources  |
|  (primary data)  |     |  (unified layer)  |     |   (r4/v1 sync)   |
+------------------+     +-------------------+     +------------------+
```

We read from the local database. We do optimistic updates, write to r4 and optionally `pull` data to refresh it. 

1. App starts → loads from local database
2. As the user browses and plays it triggers sync → `.pull()` methods 
3. User adds tracks → saves local first, persists to r4
